## Main Concept
The player controls the cylinder inside of an invisible box. They are able to move around using WASD and shoot bullets using the "E" key. The moving capsule at the end of the screen will move and periodically instantiate enemies for the player to shoot. If they hit the enemy, it will be destroyed and a set amount of points will be gained. If the player is hit by an enemy bullet, they will lose a life. If the player loses all 3 lives, the game will end and a restart button will appear. Once enough enemies have been killed, the camera will change position and create a new environment for the player to move around and attack enemies in. There are 2 camera positions: Side-On and Top-Down.
